## 📘 Overview

This repository provides the official simulation framework and validation environment for the research presented in:

> **A Safe and Robust Control System Architecture for Virtual Coupling**  
> *Mario Terlizzi, Luigi Glielmo, Davide Liuzza*  
> 🏆 *Awarded in collaboration with* [**Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI)**] 
> 🎤 *Presented at the* [**World Congress on High-Speed Rail 2025**]([https://uic.org/events/world-congress-on-high-speed-rail](https://app1.uichighspeed.org/calendar)), July 2025  . Session 5.1 - Signalling & control systems  - 8 July 

The tool supports the development, testing, and safety validation of a next-generation control architecture that facilitates the transition from ETCS Level 3 to Virtual Coupling (VC) operations — a key concept for ETCS Level 4.

## ✨ Features

✅ Modular simulation framework for two-train VC scenarios  
✅ Full support for parametric uncertainty and non-ideal communication  
✅ Certified safety via **Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)**  
✅ Emergency and cruise control strategies for robust train platooning  
✅ Real-time **Delay Estimator Module**  
✅ Extendable for future research in multi-train convoys and hybrid control

## 🧠 System Architecture

This tool implements a composable, safety-centric architecture with the following key blocks:

<details>
<summary><strong>🧩 Leader RLP Predictor</strong></summary>

Estimates the **Robust Lower Proxy (RLP)** of the leader’s trajectory under worst-case (emergency braking) assumptions.
Ensures the follower can predict a minimum safe trajectory in the absence of fresh data.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🛡️ Safety Control Block</strong></summary>

Implements a **Control Barrier Function**-based safety supervisor.  
Triggers **emergency braking** of the follower if predicted trajectories violate safety guarantees.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚦 Cruise Virtual Coupling Block</strong></summary>

Predictive controller that regulates the follower’s position during normal operations, optimizing speed tracking and spacing with real-time adaptation based on communication health.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⏱️ Delay Estimator Block (Optional)</strong></summary>

Estimates packet delay distributions and updates a safety horizon dynamically.  
Mitigates unnecessary braking due to transient communication issues.
</details>
