The relentless pursuit of autonomous vehicle technology has reached a pivotal stage where perception systems define the frontier of innovation. Within this purview, the contributions presented in Chapters 3 and 4 of this thesis underscore pivotal enhancements in the perception capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous driving systems, respectively.

Chapter 3 delineates a novel perception algorithm for UAVs, which marries the pure pursuit method with advanced image processing techniques. This hybrid approach leverages the computational simplicity of the pure pursuit method while significantly enhancing the UAV's environmental perception and path tracking ability. The algorithm's distinction lies in its capacity to adapt to varied and complex operational environments—a critical factor for autonomous navigation. By integrating real-time image processing, the algorithm can discern and follow paths with unprecedented accuracy and reduced computational demand. This innovation is not only a testament to the robustness required for autonomous vehicular technology but also aligns with the open-source ethos, enabling wide-scale replication and iterative improvements.

Chapter 4 introduces an Iterative Tree Search (ITS) approach for real-time lane detection, a quintessential task for autonomous driving. The ITS algorithm deviates from traditional lane detection methods that rely on extensive feature extraction and complex models. Instead, it proposes a pixel-level analysis, which streamlines the detection process, rendering it time-efficient and more suited for embedded systems within autonomous vehicles. This method reflects an evolution of perception systems towards greater computational efficiency, enabling the detection process to operate within the stringent temporal constraints of autonomous driving.

The common thread uniting these contributions is their focus on improving perception—a sensory cornerstone for \gls{av}. Perception is not merely about sensing but involves the interpretation of environmental data to make split-second decisions. In autonomous vehicles, the quality of perception directly influences decision-making algorithms, impacting safety, reliability, and the overall user experience.

The significance of these contributions can be viewed through the lens of their practical applicability. The enhanced path tracking algorithm for UAVs is particularly relevant for search and rescue operations, agricultural monitoring, and surveillance—domains where UAVs must navigate autonomously with high precision. Similarly, the ITS algorithm's implications for autonomous driving extend to urban and highway scenarios where reliable lane detection is crucial for maintaining vehicle trajectory and safety.

Furthermore, these advancements contribute to the overarching goal of creating autonomous vehicles that can operate seamlessly alongside human-driven vehicles. By improving perception systems, we edge closer to harmonizing the coexistence of autonomous and manually controlled vehicles, ensuring a safer and more efficient transportation ecosystem.

In conclusion, the thesis presents two pivotal contributions to the field of autonomous vehicle perception. These innovations not only advance the technical capabilities of \gls{av} but also offer insights into the trajectory of future research and development. As the autonomous vehicle industry continues to evolve, the emphasis on perception systems will undoubtedly remain at the forefront, with the potential to redefine transportation as we know it.


This portion of the thesis underscores the advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) control systems amidst unpredictable scenarios and cybersecurity threats. Chapters 5 and 6 are critical in bolstering the intelligence and safety frameworks that underpin AV technology.

Chapter 5 presents an innovative approach to AV control using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), specifically adopting the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method. This method optimizes the AV's ability to navigate complex environments where pedestrian behavior is unpredictable. The DDPG algorithm is a breakthrough, enabling AVs to learn optimal control policies offline, which are crucial for real-time adaptive driving strategies. The algorithm's efficacy is demonstrated through a series of simulations where the AV must balance pedestrian safety with adherence to its driving trajectory. The results indicate a robust performance in terms of learning speed and quality of the driving policy, ensuring the AV's operational safety in pedestrian-rich environments.

Chapter 6 delves into the realm of cybersecurity, introducing a proactive cyber-attack detection and countermeasure strategy, particularly during critical driving maneuvers such as overtaking. It proposes the Intelligent Model Predictive Control System (I-MPS), an architecture that integrates control, prevention, and mitigation mechanisms against cyber threats. The I-MPS utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict and neutralize cyber-attacks in real-time, preserving the integrity of the AV's control systems. This system is pivotal in ensuring that AVs can maintain safety and performance standards, even in the face of sophisticated cyber-attacks. The chapter illustrates the I-MPS's effectiveness through simulations, highlighting its rapid response to threats and its capacity to uphold safe driving practices.

The contributions detailed in these chapters are instrumental in advancing the state of AV technology. The DDPG algorithm's application to pedestrian unpredictability addresses a critical aspect of urban AV deployment, providing a pathway to more nuanced and responsive driving behaviors. Concurrently, the I-MPS framework equips AVs with the necessary defenses against evolving cybersecurity risks, a concern of increasing significance as AVs become more interconnected.

Moreover, these chapters contribute to the broader discourse on AV reliability and trustworthiness. By enhancing learning algorithms and cybersecurity measures, the thesis advocates for a multifaceted approach to AV safety that accommodates both operational unpredictability and digital security threats. These advancements serve as a foundation for future research, potentially influencing regulations and standards for AV deployment.

In essence, the research presented in these sections not only propels technological capabilities but also addresses societal expectations for secure and intelligent AVs. As the AV industry progresses, the insights from this thesis will be vital in shaping the trajectory of AV development, prioritizing resilience, adaptability, and security in an ever-evolving vehicular landscape.
