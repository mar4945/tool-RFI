%\lhead{\bfseries ABSTRACT}
In an era defined by rapid technological advancements, the integration of advanced control and learning-based techniques has ushered in transformative possibilities across multiple domains. Robotics, autonomous systems, and industrial processes have all benefited from these synergies, leading to enhanced system performance, elevated safety measures, and efficient fault detection mechanisms. 
At the heart of this research is the question of how control and learning can be seamlessly integrated to harness their collective strengths. The synthesis of control's stability assurance and learning's adaptability forms the basis for a new frontier of research, one that transcends conventional boundaries to address challenges that were previously deemed insurmountable. However....
This thesis embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the intersections between control theory, learning algorithms, and real-world applications, with a specific focus on ensuring safety in autonomous systems and industrial operations.
